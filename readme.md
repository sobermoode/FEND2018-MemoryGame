# FEND2018-Project2

## Memory game

Project 2 for the Udacity FEND nanodegree.

Sixteen cards are randomly dealt out onto the board, face down. Click on two cards per turn.
If both cards are the same, it's a match. If not, the cards are turned back over, and
remain in the same place. Match all the cards to win!

Above the card table is the scoreboard. You have a star rating, a timer, and a move counter.
More moves means less stars. Try to earn three stars!!!

There's a refresh button at the bottom, if necessary.
